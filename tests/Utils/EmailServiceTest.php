        // Here, we are primarily testing that the method executes and returns true,
        // implicitly assuming mail() would succeed.

        // We can't directly assert the mail content here without more advanced mocking.
        // The key components of the email (username, verification link) are tested
        // indirectly in UserTest (token generation) and VerificationPageTest (link usage).

        // For a simple test, we can't easily intercept mail().
        // We are just checking if the function completes and returns true.
        // If mail() were to fail and EmailService handled it by returning false,
        // that would be the main thing to check.
        
        // Note: If mail() is not configured on the test system, it might return false.
        // This test assumes a best-case scenario for mail() or that it's stubbed/mocked
        // at a lower level if such tools were in use.

        // To make this test more robust without full mail mocking, one might:
        // 1. Refactor EmailService to accept a MailerInterface, which can be mocked.
        // 2. Use a library like php-mock to redefine mail() within the test's scope.
        // For now, we'll call it and expect true, assuming mail() "works".

        // This assertion depends on the actual mail configuration of the PHP environment
        // where tests are run. If mail() is not configured, it will likely return false.
        // For the purpose of this exercise, we'll assume it would return true if configured.
        // A more realistic test would involve mocking mail() or the mailer.
        $this->assertTrue($result, "EmailService::sendVerificationEmail should return true, assuming mail() is operational or stubbed to succeed. If this fails, check mail configuration or consider this test limited by mail() dependency.");

        // To simulate a failure, one would need to make mail() return false.
        // e.g., by trying to send to an invalidly formatted address IF mail() checks that,
        // or by advanced mocking.
